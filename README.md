# Heart-Diease-Prediction
A high-accuracy model for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using dual-stage stacked machine learning (RF, XGBoost, DT) with hyperparameter tuning. Future enhancements include deep learning (CNN, RNN, Transformers), AutoML, and cloud deployment for real-time, interpretable, and scalable risk prediction.
